## Introduction:
Brief description of the project
Our main idea is focused towards free-lancing github where the developer in need raises issues and allocates amount to it as a smart contract now this issue is visible to the community of developers, and when the developers find that they might have solved it then they send a pull request to the issue raiser, the issue raiser then goes through the the pull request and if satisfied he/she merges it , and as soon as he merges it the transaction is completed through the contract . The issue-raiser allocates a deadline for the issue to be resolved and if itâ€™s not resolved within the specified deadline the allocated amount is refunded back to the issue-raiser.
